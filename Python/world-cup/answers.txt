Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
That Spain had the highest chance of winning.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
100,000 simulations, a million simulations takes a lot longer than 100,000.
