To calculte the aura, the following line of code would be used:
SELECT AVG(energy), AVG(valence), AVG(danceability) FROM songs;
Then looking at each of these three values, the Audio Aura score
would be calculated combining them and taking the average. This value
may be compared to a chart, where a certain range of Audio Aura values
represents a certain mood.

 This many not be fully representative as a song contains other Characteristics
 like Loudness, Speechiness and Tempo.
 A more representative figure would take the average value of these
 three characteristics into account as well.
