I want to convert my decimal number to binary
how will I do this?

Okay, so I want to take my decimal number
which is stored in the array respectively,

Lets create a binary array. Binary[w][8]
this array will have 2 arrays.
w is the lengh of the string, so each
specific value of the binary array will
store one character. The 8 represents the
number of 'bits'. Basically, for each character
the 2nd array will store either a 0 or 1.
so it may look like this:
number = 123
binary[0] = 123
binary[0][0] = 0
binary[0][1] = 1
binary[0][2] = 1
binary[0][3] = 1
binary[0][4] = 1
binary[0][5] = 0
binary[0][6] = 1
binary[0][7] = 1

when I print each of the binary arrays of 0
they should give me:
01111011 which is the binary number.
now to implement this...
